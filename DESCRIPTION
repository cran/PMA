Description: Performs Penalized Multivariate Analysis: a penalized
        matrix decomposition, sparse principal components analysis, and
        sparse canonical correlation analysis, described in the
        following papers: (1) Witten, Tibshirani and Hastie (2009) A
        penalized matrix decomposition, with applications to sparse
        principal components and canonical correlation analysis.
        Biostatistics 10(3):515-534. (2) Witten and Tibshirani (2009)
        Extensions of sparse canonical correlation analysis, with
        applications to genomic data. Statistical Applications in
